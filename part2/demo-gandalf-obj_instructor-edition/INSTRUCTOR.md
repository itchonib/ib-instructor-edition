## Instructor Edition: Gandalf Objects

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª All annotations and guided notes for this lesson will be denoted be the woman technologist emoji these contain great speaking bits and tips to enhance the lesson.

### Context

- Only the script is necessary to look at for this demo. Will only use the console.
- This will be a demo of creating an `Gandalf` object and then console logging. Essentially just showing of that an object can have any JavaScript data types and even functions as values.
- Some vocab
  - Objects are made of up properties
  - properties are an associate between a key (or name) and a value

### Overall Plan

üí¨ [LI] Do ‚û°Ô∏è

- Start off by creating a new object literal called `gandalf` and begin filling it with the fields from the completed. _Go through as many as the fifteen minutes permit!_
  - Add the `name` and `age` properties and log them to the console using dot notation
  - Add the `aliases` field and log the length of it to the console to show we can work with arrays as we normally would.
  - Outside of the object, use the assignment operator to create a new field - `gandalf.ring`. Log it to the console and confirm it works
  - Create the `shallPass` method and invoke it.
  - Finish up by talking about the difference between accessing properties with dot and bracket notation. Create the `ageProperty` variable and try to access an object property with it.
